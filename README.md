# Project Title: Customer Churn Prediction using Python

##  Short Description / Purpose:

I built this project to predict customer churn using machine learning.
It helps understand why customers leave and supports businesses to improve retention strategies.

## Tech Stack:

Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

## Data Source:

Used the Telco Customer Churn dataset (from Kaggle).

## It has features like:

Demographics (gender, senior citizen)
Services (Internet, Phone, Streaming)

## Charges & tenure:

Contract type & payment method
Target column: Churn (Yes/No)

## Features / Highlights:

## Business problem:

Telecom company wants to identify which customers are likely to churn â€” so they can act early.

## Goal of the notebook:

Build a model to predict churn, explore key drivers, and visualize insights.

## Walkthrough of key steps:

Data cleaning: Handle missing values, convert TotalCharges to numeric.

EDA: Visualize churn distribution, check effect of MonthlyCharges & Contract type.

Encoding & scaling: Prepare data for ML.

Modeling: Logistic Regression & Random Forest.

Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, ROC-AUC.

Feature importance: Identify which features affect churn most.

## Business impact & insights:

Find customer segments most at risk.

Learn which factors (e.g., contract type, monthly charges) drive churn.

Help business design better offers & retain valuable customers.
